# Devfont

Devfont is a premium, simply and beautiful set of 400+ open source icons for designers and developers. Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on readability, consistency, simplicity, flexibility and perfect pixels. Of course, all the icons are free for both personal and commercial use.

Search, preview and download at [devfont.com](https://devfont.com)

```shell
npm install devfont
```

> I also publish the icons to npm as `devfont`, but i don't consider the directory structure stable yet and it could change in any release, so use the npm package at your own risk right now.
