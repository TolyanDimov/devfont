# Contribution Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Devfont. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Pull Requests

> **Note:** At the moment i am not accepting pull requests containing **icons**. The best way to contribute an icon is to create an issue with a screenshot and link to an SVG of your icon.

Pull requests for new features, bug fixes, etc. are often appreciated.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

### Guidelines for pull requests

- __Make your commit messages as descriptive as possible.__ Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that the file diffs themselves wonâ€™t make apparent.
- __Document your pull request__. Explain your fix, link to the relevant issue, add screenshots when adding new icons.
- __Include only related work__. If your pull request has unrelated commit, it won't be accepted.

## Icon Requests

Before creating an icon request, please search to see if someone has requested the icon already. If there is an open request, please add a :+1:.

If the icon has not already been requested, [create an issue](https://github.com/devfont/devfont/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:) with a title of `Icon request: <icon name>` and add as much information as possible.

## Bug Reports

Before reporting an issue, please search to see if someone has filed a similar issue before. If there is already an open issue, please add a :+1: and/or leave a comment with additional information.
